# 💻 DataBro: Sales Data Analysis & Visualization Server (FastMCP) 📈

This repository hosts a data analysis server built with the **FastMCP** framework, designed to process and visualize sales transaction data. It exposes powerful, easy-to-use tools for summarizing CSV datasets and generating visual insights, such as bar charts.

---

## 🌟 Features

* **CSV Data Ingestion:** Safely reads and processes sales data from a raw CSV text format using Pandas.
* **Data Summarization:** Provides comprehensive statistical summaries (`df.describe`) and structural column information (`df.info`).
* **Bar Chart Visualization:** Generates and returns Base64 encoded PNG images for quick visual analysis of key metrics (e.g., product performance, sales representative output).
* **FastMCP Integration:** Uses the FastMCP library to expose these analysis functions as a dedicated, callable server/service.
